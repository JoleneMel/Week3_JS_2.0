//This is a set up for a redo of a old project, saw other ways to do it and I want to do it again but differently 
// Create an array called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.

// Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array (do not use numbers to reference the last 
//element, find it programmatically, ages[7] – ages[0] is not allowed). Print the result to the console.

// Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic (works for arrays of different lengths).

// Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age. Print the result to the console.


//Create an array called names that contains the following values: ‘Sam’, ‘Tommy’, ‘Tim’, ‘Sally’, ‘Buck’, ‘Bob’.

// Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average number of letters per name. Print the result to the console.

// Use a loop to iterate through the array again and concatenate all the names together, separated by spaces, and print the result to the console.

// How do you access the last element of any array?

// How do you access the first element of any array?
